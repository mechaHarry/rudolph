# Rudolph

## Install Locally For Development

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Turn on `Developer mode`.
3. Click `Load unpacked`.
4. Select the cloned `rudolph` repository folder.
5. Open a new tab. Chrome should load Rudolph as the new-tab page.

After editing files, return to `chrome://extensions` and click the reload button on the Rudolph extension card, then open a new tab again.

## What Rudolph Is

Rudolph is a customizable Chrome new-tab dashboard for tracking market symbols. It shows live quote data, after-hours movement, and draggable chart widgets for intraday, monthly, yearly, and all-time views.

The dashboard stores layout, selected symbols, hidden widgets, theme, and appearance preferences locally in the browser. It does not require a backend service.

## Features

- Live stock watchlist with search and removable tracked symbols.
- Default fresh-install watchlist using broad popular market symbols.
- Header quote summary with regular and extended-hours prices.
- Draggable and resizable Gridstack dashboard widgets.
- Chart.js visualizations for hour, day, month, year, and all-time ranges.
- Theme families for Samsung OneUI, Apple Liquid Glass, Cisco Momentum, Windows Fluent, Google Material, and IBM Carbon.
- Independent appearance mode: `Auto`, `Light`, or `Dark`.
- Auto appearance follows Chrome/system color settings where supported.

## Data Source

Stock data is fetched directly from Yahoo Finance endpoints declared in `manifest.json`:

```json
"host_permissions": [
  "https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/*"
]
```

The app includes graceful fallback behavior for chart and quote loading, and shows placeholders while data is still loading.

## Development

This project is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is no build step required for normal extension development.

Useful checks:

```bash
node --test test/extended-hours.test.js
node --test test/package-release.test.js
node --check js/app.js
```

Useful local preview:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8765
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html
```

The extension entrypoint is `newtab.html`; `index.html` is useful for local browser preview.

## Packaging

Semantic version tracking lives in `VERSION`, and `manifest.json` must use the same version.

Create the Chrome extension package:

```bash
./package.sh
```

This creates one installable extension zip in `dist/`, with `manifest.json` at the zip root:

```text
dist/Rudolph-<version>-chrome-extension.zip
```

## Release

Create a signed semantic version tag and publish a GitHub release:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=... ./release.sh
```

The release script:

- Reads `VERSION`.
- Requires `manifest.json` to match `VERSION`.
- Creates a signed tag named `v<VERSION>`.
- Pushes the tag to `origin`.
- Packages the extension.
- Creates a GitHub release with generated release notes.
- Uploads the single extension zip as the release asset.

Preview without creating tags or releases:

```bash
./release.sh --dry-run
```
